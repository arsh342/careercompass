### Key Directories Explained

#### 🤖 `/src/ai/`

Contains all AI-related functionality including Genkit flows, model configurations, and AI utility functions. Each flow is responsible for a specific AI task like candidate ranking or resume parsing.

#### 🌐 `/src/app/`

Next.js 13+ app directory structure with route groups for organizing authenticated and public routes. API routes handle server-side logic and AI integrations.

#### 🧩 `/src/components/`

Modular component architecture with a base UI library and application-specific components. Components are designed for reusability and consistency.

#### 🔄 `/src/context/`

React Context providers for global state management including authentication, theme, and application-specific state like saved opportunities.
